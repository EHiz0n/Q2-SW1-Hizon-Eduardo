                <td><strong>Hatsumi Sen</strong><br />This man is completely irresponsible, laid back and cool, yet is said to be a top class fighter within the Kengan Association. Known as the "Floating Cloud", Hatsumi Sen has a loss of 15 fights, but the reasons are was because 4 were skipped, 2 were forgotten, and 9 were overslept. Despite this, he's still infamous thanks to his skill and technique and Hatsumi-Styled Aikido. Even though he is relaxed and calm, he will put his all onto fights which he knows will be trouble, like the second and third rounds he would participate in in the tournament. He represents the Nogi Group and proves his worth despite looking like the chillest man you could walk upon. </td>
